    <h2>Phnom Da</h2>
    <p>The Phnom Da is a granite outcrop and a historic site about 3 kilometers southeast from Angkor Borei. It is notable for the oldest surviving temples, Khmer and Sanskrit inscriptions as a source, as well as perhaps the earliest Cambodian stone statues, based on the epigraphical evidence, iconography, and style, in Cambodia.</p>
